Write me a poem about traveling to the great outdoors in vermont
 Sure! Here's a poem about traveling to the great outdoors in Vermont:

In Vermont's green hills, I find my peace
Where the mountains rise high, and the rivers cease
The trees sway gently in the breeze
As I breathe in the scent of the wild, freeze

The air is crisp and clean, the sky is blue
I feel alive, my spirit anew
I hike through the woods, my heart full of cheer
As the leaves crunch beneath my feet, my fears disappear

MINSTREL INSTRUCT 

Write me a poem about traveling to the great outdoors in vermont
In the heart of New England, where the green mountains stand,

Awaits a journey, through the great outdoors of Vermont's land.

Breathe in deep, the crisp and cool, morning air so pure,

A symphony of nature, in every scent and allure.

Through winding roads, past quaint little towns,

Where maple trees dance in the sun's golden crowns.

The leaves whisper tales, of seasons past,

As autumn's hues paint the landscape, in a brilliant, fiery cast.

Rivers rush and streams flow, in a gentle, soothing song,

Reflecting the sky's ever-changing moods, all day long.
